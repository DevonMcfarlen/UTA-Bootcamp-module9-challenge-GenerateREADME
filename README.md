  ## Description <a name="description"></a>
  
  This a a small program to help developers quickly make professional README's for their projects. All you have to do is answer the simple questions the program prompts you with, and it will create a nice looking, professional README. <br> Creating this program helped solidify how to use inquirer, and how to use data to write a file for use outside of the program.
