# Professional README Generator Starter Code

[How to create a Professional README](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide)

## Description

I made this for a challenge for the UTA Fullstack Development bootcamp. It's a simple quiz that reacts to a users button clicks to start and move through the quiz.
It also keeps track of how long the user takes to complete the quiz, and ends the quiz when time runs out. An incorrect answer also reduced the remaining time by 10 seconds.
After the quiz is over the user can input their initials to save their score onto the local storage, which can be cleared from the highscores page.
<br>
This challenge helped me further my skills with getting and using a user's input to affect a webpage, and helped me learn how to store, retrieve and clear data from the local storage.
